# opengl-quake

A simple Quake map viewer in OpenGL originally made by Johan Gardhage and further improved by Bruno Hayek.

The main goal for this fork is to render the Quake map viewer using the Fast Inverse Square Root, a traditional calculation method or a Taylor series approximation. More details are give in the following repository: https://github.com/BrunoEAH/FISR-3D-Rendering. We have further improved the building file so that it also generates a executable for Windows. In the end, we adapted the code to C++20 and also added a window to see the benchmark for each calculation method.

## Prerequisites

To build opengl-quake, you must first install the following tools:

- [SDL 2.0.4](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) (or later)
- [GLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Utility_Library)
- [Ninja 1.5](https://ninja-build.org/) (or later)
- C++20

### Install dependencies

#### openSUSE

`$ sudo zypper install ninja gcc-c++ libSDL2-devel glu-devel`

#### Ubuntu

`$ sudo apt install ninja-build g++ libsdl2-dev libglu1-mesa-dev`

## Build instructions

To build the quake demo program, run:

`$ ninja`

A `build` directory will be created, containing the demo program.
